The expressions you've provided seem to be close but need some adjustments for clarity and correctness in the context of survival analysis. Here are the corrected expressions:

1. $f(T > t)$ should be $f(t)$: This is the probability density function (PDF) of the random variable $T$ at time $t$. It describes the likelihood of the event occurring at exactly time $t$.

2. $S(T < t)$ should be $S(t) = P(T > t)$: This is the survival function, representing the probability that the event time $T$ is greater than some time $t$. It is the complement of the cumulative distribution function (CDF).

3. $h(T > t)$ should be $h(t)$: This is the hazard function, which represents the instantaneous rate at which events occur at time $t$, given that the subject has survived up to time $t$.

So, the corrected expressions are:

1. $f(t)$: Probability density function
2. $S(t) = P(T > t)$: Survival function
3. $h(t)$: Hazard function

These are the standard notations in survival analysis.
