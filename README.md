"Frutta" with actual top Italian fruits, focusing on those traditionally grown and consumed in Italy. Considering Italy's climate and culinary traditions, fruits like grapes, olives (technically a fruit), lemons, figs, peaches, cherries, apples, pears, oranges, apricots, plums, and strawberries are among the top choices. Here's how the corrected markdown looks, taking into account these adjustments:

I replaced the fruits listed with ones that are more commonly associated with Italian cuisine and agriculture. Italy's rich culinary heritage emphasizes the use of `fresh`, `locally` grown produce, and these fruits play a significant role in both Italian cooking and eating habits. From the `grapes` that go into Italy's world-renowned wines to the `olives` that produce some of the finest olive oils, each fruit has its place in the heart of Italian cuisine.
