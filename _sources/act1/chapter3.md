## Time 1, 2, 3
- Chaos: Time-to-event (grief, love)
- Frenzy: No broken vow to duty or calling
- Emotion: Instantaneous likelihood of breaking oath

## Archetypes 4
- Dionysian: stories: arcs (n) x values: honor-duty $(p)$ design matrix

## Precision 5, 6
- Algorithm defining `weights` of values or $(p)$ in relation to our fate and `destiny`
- Binary: if an archetype is theme, you are one of the unique variations; no two people are identical
