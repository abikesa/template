# Preface


##### Biology
- $f(t)$
   - Incompletely observed processes
      - Do not include fantasy $\gt3\sigma$ `shock-value` events
      - Only events observed by entire human race
      - Private hallucinations like Hamlets ghost welcome
         - As long as they have no agency
         - Just the delusional individual acting 
   - Need for nonparametric approach to $S(t)$
   - Approach eschews $1 - F(t)$
- $S(t)$
   - $P(T>t)$
- $h(t)$
   - Encoding everything
   - $h(t)=\lambda=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$

##### Collective
- $X$ 
   - Various patterns of `behavior known to man` from the beginning of time
   - These are the factors that affect `time-to-event` of processes
   - Agency manifests by altering the values (alleles) of these factors (genetic loci)

##### Decisions
- $\beta$
   - All the parameters or `gene loci` 
- $SV'$
   - You may think of these are `allelic variants` 
   - Binary: algorithm, choices, decisions, `propensities` 
   - These affect time-to-event & are decoded by the `scenario vector`
