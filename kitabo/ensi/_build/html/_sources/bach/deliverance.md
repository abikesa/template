2. Narrative
   - Your interpretation aligns with a profound understanding of the metaphor. Viewing life as a dream within the temporal confines of a narrow window, such as sleep, captures the transient and limited nature of our existence. The idea that there's something more significant or beyond our immediate awareness adds a layer of mystery, inviting contemplation about the broader and perhaps hidden aspects of our reality. It's a thought-provoking perspective on the depth and potential vastness of our experience. One is reminded of [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)
      - We are such stuff As dreams are made on
      - And our little life is rounded with a sleep

   - Reverence
      - I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him: his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang'd, our case is miserable.
      - "The Tempest" indeed weaves together didactic and aesthetic elements through its dialogue and characters. The contrast between the irreverence expressed by the Boatswain, who prioritizes the ship's safety over deference to the nobility, and the expectations of Alonso and Gonzalo reflects deeper themes. This interplay explores hierarchy, authority, and the unpredictable forces of nature, providing layers of meaning beyond the surface plot. Shakespeare's skill in blending these elements adds depth to the play's exploration of human nature and societal dynamics.
   - Inference
      - The use of a `bVÃ¸7` chord, or a flat five half-diminished seventh chord
      - Not typical for the Baroque period in the way we think about harmonic progressions today
      - Quite advanced, potentially serving as a chromatic passing chord or part of a secondary dominant sequence leading to an unexpected resolution, showcasing Bach's mastery over tension and release
      - Bach introduces it in the 5th bar
         - bv - vii - ii - I
         - II - vii - V - V
         - iii - vi - ii - V
         - I - I - I - I
      - His music is indeed known for its didactic qualities, conveying intricate musical concepts while maintaining a sense of beauty and emotional depth. The subtlety with which he incorporates educational `elements` makes his compositions accessible and enjoyable, even for those who may not be consciously aware of the underlying structure. It's a testament to Bach's mastery that his music can be both instructive and profoundly moving. 
   - Deliverence
      - Absolutely, you've touched upon a key aspect of great art. While a compelling plot or musical structure is essential, it's often the depth found in `ordinary` conversations, subtle nuances, and the interplay of characters or musical phrases that elevate the work to greatness. Profound didactic elements embedded in the seemingly `mundane` contribute to a richer and more nuanced experience for the audience. It's this ability to infuse `meaning` into the everyday that can make art resonate on a profound and enduring level. Methinks this is the essence of "deliverence" from the grave, the serious, the existential!
5. Symbol
   - Of the times. 
      1. **Consumerism and the Quest for Novelty:** The exponential increase in the usage of the word "[mundane](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=mundane&year_start=1500&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=true)" from 1950 onward, as you've observed through Google's data, might indeed reflect broader societal changes, including those driven by capitalism. The word "mundane" itself means relating to the world or worldly matters as opposed to spiritual ones, and it often carries connotations of being ordinary, routine, or lacking excitement. This linguistic trend can be analyzed from several angles, particularly within the framework of capitalism and its societal impacts. `Capitalism`, especially in its late 20th and early 21st-century forms, has been characterized by rapid consumerism and an ever-increasing quest for novelty. This environment might lead to a greater awareness and discussion of the "mundane" or ordinary, as individuals seek distinction from routine through consumption. The mundane becomes a backdrop against which the new and exciting are highlighted.

      2. **Media and Cultural Production:** The proliferation of media and cultural products under capitalism has made the extraordinary more accessible, thereby rendering the ordinary ("mundane") more visible and, paradoxically, more noteworthy. As media narratives often focus on breaking from the mundane, the term itself may become more prevalent in discourse.

      3. **Philosophical and Societal Reflection:** The post-World War II era, starting around 1950, ushered in significant societal and philosophical questioning, including critiques of consumer culture, existential reflections on meaning, and the role of the individual in society. In such discussions, the concept of the mundane becomes central as people reflect on the nature of daily life under capitalism.

      4. **Technological Change and Everyday Life:** Rapid technological advancements have transformed everyday life, making what was once extraordinary into something mundane. The discourse around these changes may contribute to the increased use of the term as society grapples with the implications of technology on daily existence.

      5. **Capitalism and Alienation:** Theories of alienation, notably from Marxist thought, argue that capitalism can lead to individuals feeling disconnected from their work, products, and fellow humans. This alienation may make the mundane aspects of life under capitalism more pronounced, as people seek meaning and fulfillment in a system often critiqued for prioritizing profit over human needs. While blaming capitalism for the increased usage of "mundane" might be an oversimplification, it's clear that the economic, social, and cultural shifts associated with capitalism have likely influenced how and why certain terms gain prominence in our lexicon. This linguistic trend can serve as a mirror reflecting broader societal anxieties, desires, and critiques related to the everyday experiences of living in a capitalist society.
