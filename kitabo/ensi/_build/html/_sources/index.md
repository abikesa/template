# Aim 1


##### Biology
- $f(t)$
   - Incompletely observed processes
   - Need for nonparametric approach to $S(t)$
   - Approach eschews $1 - F(t)$
- $S(t)$
   - $P(T>t)$
- $h(t)$
   - Encoding everything
   - $h(t)=\lambda=]frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$

##### Collective
- $X$ various patterns of behavior known to man from the beginning of time

##### Personal
- $\beta$
- $SV'$
   - Binary: algorithm, choices, decisions, `propensities` 
   - These affect time-to-event & are decoded by the `scenario vector`
