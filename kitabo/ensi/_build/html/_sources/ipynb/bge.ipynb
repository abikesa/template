Our cumulative heritage hands us an approach out of the spirit of music: what we are handed `displaces` us from the root to `ii`. And our forbears offer a step-wise, tried & tasted, well-trodden journey \"back\" home: `ii-V7-i`\n",

Rather, an obstacle-course that tests your strength, resilience, and build your muscle, bone, stamina, as well as emotional tension: your libido and drive is now like a dammed river, which builds a reservoir for future energy needs. Modes-qualities-relatives are the tools that create context for future surprises, tension, release\n",
