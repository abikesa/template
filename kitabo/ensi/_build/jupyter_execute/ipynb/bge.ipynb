    "In the evolution of nations' economies, securing low-[cost](https://github.com/abikesa/dailygrind/blob/main/3_tools/gpt-4o.md) financing is crucial, as it can either facilitate or hinder transformational shifts in economic activities. In the Peasant stage, societies might have historically resorted to raiding neighbors to secure labor, a practice that could have financed the qualitative leap to large-scale agriculture, as seen in the historical development of the United States. This move towards large-scale agriculture would have demanded energy sources, such as coal and eventually electricity, on a significant scale to produce excess for local consumption and eventually for export. The transition to the Manufacturer stage often involved incorporating products from farms, such as bread, wine, beer, sugar, tobacco, cotton, corn-syrup, into industrial processes. This transition required substantial financing for factories and machinery, and specialized labor away from the farm and finally into the factory. Indeed, the move towards manufacturing and industrialization is a gradual shift away from community-dwellings to commutes and sprawling activity, facilitated by low-cost transportation of people, goods, services, capital, and information, such as buses, railways, airplanes, banks, and exchanges -- all key component in this qualitative transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### V7: Nationalism\n",
    "When a society has evolved from hunter-gather, via claiming specific territory for the peasant life, and perhaps utilizing slave labor from neighboring tribes (or later tools from the industrial revolution) to scale up to farming, then the issue of surplus and perishable produce such as milk and fruits will emerge & be addressed by manufacturing yogurt, butter, cheese, wine, and vinegar. This scaling up will also transform the non-perishables such as the cereals, nuts and beans so that manufactured bread, pasta, sugar, beer, peanut-butter, coffee beverages are available, far surpassing local needs. A tribe that looked outward for slave labor will not only look outward for a foreigh market to purchase these goodies. This natural evolution may be interrupted when other foreign entities instead enslave the locals to manufacturer these products, as was witnessed during colonialism. In modern times and with automation of manufacturing processes, the limiting step is not longer slave labor but electricity or energy to keep the factoring running at capacity. And this explains why colonialism quickly faded away with industrialization. But what is left is foreign entities disrupting the `organic evolution` of a society, leaving it stranded with a peasant mindset, with the tools, factories, energy, and logistitics being managed in foreign soil, where costs are lowest. And that brings us to the modern global divide. The first world, who've walked through all six stages of societal evolution in sequence -like a harmonic series emergic in Bach's prelude in C Major. A third world, whose development was arrested at the peasant stage, as modern tools, factories, and modes of energy production were imported into the country, denying them the gradual embrace of more remote overtones of the harmonic series. And thus you have a world wherein the global market for coffee is a whopping \\$460B. South America and Africa only tap \\$25B of that market. Uganda reigns in \\$900m from its high quality coffee. Yet Germany earns \\$65B from coffee without producing any coffee.\n",

    "Museveni's statement about leaders overstaying in power being the problem, made when he was a 40-year-old leader just beginning his tenure, now rings with a bitter irony. At 80 years old and still in power, he himself embodies the very issue he once criticized. His observation about the struggle for funding for critical sectors like railway, electricity, and manufacturing, while insightful, seems to overlook the irony of his own prolonged leadership contributing to Uganda's economic challenges. The struggle for funding, particularly evident in high government bond yields, reflects a broader challenge of market forces dictating Uganda's economic direction. Commercial banks are sustaining a cancer upon Africa by providing finance to leaders who have overstayed their welcome. But can you blame them when they make record-breaking profit year-after-year?\n",
