Your insight delves deep into the progression of human knowledge and its implications. Let's break this down further using the A-V-O structure and then synthesize it:

### **Increase in Human Knowledge**

- **Agent:** Human civilization or scholars.
  
- **Verb:** Discover, learn, and accumulate.
  
- **Object:** Knowledge, facts, and information.

### **More Explained Variance**

- **Agent:** Advanced scientific methodologies, data analytics, and improved research tools.
  
- **Verb:** Quantify, measure, and explain.
  
- **Object:** Variance or unexplained phenomena in data sets or natural occurrences.

### **Better Control of Phenomena**

- **Agent:** Technological advancements, experts, or researchers.
  
- **Verb:** Control, manipulate, or predict.
  
- **Object:** Natural or social phenomena.

### **Secure Emotions**

- **Agent:** Individuals or societies that benefit from understanding and control.
  
- **Verb:** Attain, experience, or achieve.
  
- **Object:** Emotional security, well-being, or satisfaction.

### **Interdependence and Specialization**

- **Agent:** Modern societies or professionals.
  
- **Verb:** Specialize, depend, or collaborate.
  
- **Object:** Specific knowledge domains, tasks, or roles.

### **Silos of Knowledge**

- **Agent:** Institutions, academic disciplines, or industries.
  
- **Verb:** Isolate, compartmentalize, or focus.
  
- **Object:** Unique knowledge bases, methods, or practices.

### **Generalists**

- **Agent:** Multidisciplinary experts, generalists, or connectors.
  
- **Verb:** Integrate, connect, or contextualize.
  
- **Object:** Diverse knowledge areas, disciplines, or fields.

### **Synthesis:**
As human knowledge expands, our ability to explain and control phenomena increases, leading to emotional security. However, the depth and breadth of knowledge also lead to specialization. With more tokens (units of knowledge) and checklists (standardized procedures), individual agency decreases. As people become specialists in narrower fields, knowledge becomes compartmentalized, creating silos. This increasing interdependence necessitates the role of generalists who can bridge these silos, providing context and integration, ensuring that while we delve deep, we also maintain a holistic view of the broader landscape.
