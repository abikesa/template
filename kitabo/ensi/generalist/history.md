The American music industry is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise, and as of my last update in April 2023, it is one of the largest and most influential music markets in the world. In terms of genre dominance, the percentages can vary year to year, but historically, genres like Rock, Pop, and Hip-Hop/Rap have been frontrunners. 

Rock has traditionally held a significant share, often credited with a plurality of the market, though this has been challenged in recent years by the surge in popularity of Hip-Hop/Rap. Pop music, with its broad appeal, consistently captures a large percentage of the market. Country music also holds a substantial portion of the American music industry, reflecting its deep cultural roots and widespread appeal. 

In terms of America's cultural exports, music is a major player. American artists frequently dominate global charts, and genres like Jazz, Hip-Hop, and Rock are synonymous with American culture. These genres are not just music categories; they represent the American ethos and have been integral in shaping perceptions of American culture around the world.

Evidence of this can be found in international sales and streaming data, where American artists often lead the way. Additionally, the proliferation of American music festivals and the presence of American artists at international festivals further exemplify the global influence of American music. 

`Critically` speaking, the American music industry has seen inversions in its history, where genres that were once underground or marginalized have moved to the forefront of the cultural consciousness. This can be seen in the rise of Hip-Hop from the streets of New York to global dominance, overtaking genres like Rock and Pop in terms of sales and cultural influence.

Applying the framework of deductive and inductive reasoning:

1. Using **deductive reasoning**, one might start with the broad observation that American cultural outputs like movies, music, and technology have global influence and then examine specific instances where American music charts or artists have been particularly influential.

2. Using **inductive reasoning**, one might observe specific instances of American music's global impact, such as a viral American song on social media platforms, and then generalize about the overarching dominance of American music as a cultural export.

This interplay between specific instances and general trends is vital in understanding the ebbs and flows of cultural influence and the music industry's role within it.
