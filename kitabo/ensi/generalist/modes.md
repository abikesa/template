1. $\text{R}^2$ or model fit (only a generalist would care)
2. $\beta$ or specific parameter (from select `speciality`)
3. $p$ or significance (how about magnitude of $\beta$ for specific case?)
4. Error & Variance-Bias tradeoff
5. Truth as fixed or dynamic
6. Hierarchical models, correlation in clusters, time
7. Ethics, populations enumerated, targeted, benefited, suffered
8. Sloppiness and RTC supremacy in health sciences
9. Bayesians at the gate
