The terms you're looking for that describe the movement from specific detail to general utility and vice versa are "deduction" and "induction."

1. **`D`eductive Reasoning (`D`eduction from `D`ata):** This is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion. It starts with a general statement or hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion. Deduction moves from general utility to specific detail.

2. **Inductive Reasoning (Induction from `I`nference):** This method of reasoning starts with observations and moves from specific instances to a generalized conclusion. Inductive reasoning is often used to form hypotheses and theories. Induction moves from specific detail to general utility.

In the context of your instance from `spirit of music`, these terms can be applied as follows:

- **Induction** could be used when you start with specific musical pieces or elements (like a particular use of the Dorian mode in a song) and from there, generalize about the mode's emotional impact or its use across different genres.

- **Deduction** might be applied when you begin with the general concept of the Dorian mode and predict how it will be used in a specific composition or genre, or what kind of emotional impact it might create in those specific contexts.

The categorization of musical elements and genres you've outlined is an excellent example of how both deductive and inductive reasoning can apply to music theory and history, moving from the broad understanding of musical theory to specific examples, and vice versa.

The categorization of musical genres through harmonic structures is a fascinating approach. It simplifies complex musical ideas into more digestible parts. The progression from melody to jazz, as you've outlined, seems to represent an increasing complexity in harmonic structure, perhaps mirroring the historical development of Western music:

1. **Melody/Response/Polyphony/Battlecry/Secular/Nursery** - This suggests a focus on simple melodic lines and call-and-response structures, which can be foundational for more complex genres. Polyphony marks the beginning of independent melodic lines interweaving with each other.

2. **Dyad/Renaissance** - The dyad, a two-note structure, fits well with the Renaissance era where harmony began to develop beyond unison and octave singing, but was still relatively simple.

3. **Triad/Worship/Reverence/Hymn** - The triad is the basic building block of Western harmony, often associated with sacred music and hymns, which emphasize stability and consonance.

4. **7th/Churchy/Blues** - The addition of the seventh to the triad adds tension and an edge of complexity that can evoke a more emotional or 'soulful' response, as heard in blues and some spiritual music.

5. **9th/Soul** - Extending chords to include the ninth creates a richer tapestry of sound that is often found in soul music, which expresses deep feelings and experiences.

6. **11th/RnB** - With the 11th, the harmony becomes more sophisticated and textured, common in R&B which is known for its expressive melodies and lush chords.

7. **13th/Jazz** - The 13th chord is very rich and complex, indicative of the sophistication in jazz harmony. It allows for a vast array of tonal colors and is a hallmark of the genre’s depth.

This framework is a simplified representation and doesn't account for the vast diversity within each genre or the cultural and historical contexts that give each genre its unique character. However, it’s a useful starting point for analyzing the evolution of harmony in music genres. It would be interesting to see how these concepts apply cross-culturally, considering non-Western forms of music and how they might fit into or challenge this structure.
