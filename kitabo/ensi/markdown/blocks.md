You’re absolutely right in drawing parallels between the fictional political dynamics in *Game of Thrones* and real-world political figures like Robert Mugabe and even the British monarchy. Power, as portrayed in both these realms, often resides not with the titular heads but with the courtiers and advisors who maneuver behind the scenes.

In *Game of Thrones*, King Robert Baratheon’s lament to Ned Stark about the illusion of control highlights a fundamental truth about leadership and power. Despite being the king, Robert is ensnared by the political machinations of the Lannisters, particularly his wife Cersei and her family. His realization that his supposed authority is compromised mirrors the experiences of many historical and contemporary leaders.

Robert Mugabe’s tenure as president of Zimbabwe, spanning from 1980 to 2017, is a prime example of this phenomenon. Although he was the face of Zimbabwean leadership, the real power dynamics were controlled by those around him. His downfall in 2017, orchestrated by the military and political elites who felt threatened by his wife Grace Mugabe’s ambitions, underscores how precarious and superficial his power had become. Mugabe’s ousting was a stark reminder that even the most seemingly entrenched leaders are vulnerable to the shifting loyalties and ambitions of their inner circles.

Similarly, in the British monarchy, the queen or king may appear as the ultimate authority, but in reality, they are often more symbolic than political. Queen Elizabeth II’s reign was characterized by a careful balancing act of ceremonial duties and avoiding political entanglement. King Charles III is likely to follow a similar path, maintaining the monarchy’s symbolic status while leaving the political maneuvering to elected officials and advisors. Prince Harry’s criticisms and departure from royal duties reflect his discontent with this complex, often opaque system, but they also demonstrate a misunderstanding of how power within the monarchy truly operates.

In essence, power is a delicate and often deceptive construct, frequently wielded by those who operate in the shadows rather than those who sit on the throne. This dynamic, vividly depicted in *Game of Thrones* and exemplified by figures like Robert Mugabe and the British royal family, reveals the intricate and often perilous nature of political power.

```{admonition} Highlights from the First Impact Story from 2019
**Changing the culture of data science**

> _The Turing Way_ is an online handbook – and global community – dedicated to fostering gold-standard reproducible research. It’s a cultural movement with the potential to transform data science

- There is a crisis of reproducibility  in science. 
- ‘Publish-or-perish’ incentives and excessive data secrecy stifle progress and waste resources: siloed science is slow science.

Got it! To make the variable \( X \) appear larger in LaTeX, you can use the `\displaystyle` command within a math environment to make it larger than the standard inline math size. Here is how you can do it:

```latex
\[ \displaystyle X \]
```

If you want it even larger, you can use one of the font size commands such as `\Huge`, `\huge`, `\LARGE`, `\Large`, `\large`, `\normalsize`, `\small`, `\footnotesize`, `\scriptsize`, or `\tiny`. For example:

```latex
{\Huge X}
```

Here is an example with different sizes:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\[
\text{Normal size: } X
\]

\[
\text{\Huge Large size: } X
\]

\[
\text{\LARGE Larger size: } X
\]

\[
\text{\huge Even larger size: } X
\]

\[
\text{\Huge Largest size: } X
\]

\end{document}
```

Each command modifies the size of the variable \( X \) accordingly.
